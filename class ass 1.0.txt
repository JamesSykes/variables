#Starter - Assignment Statements

These tasks are designed to refresh the reading and research you have undertaken at home prior to this lesson. If you have not completed the R&R assignment then please speak to your teacher before attempting these exercises.

##Mathematical Operators
You have been introduced the the various mathematical operators that are used in Python. Refresh your knowledge of these concepts by attempting the below tasks.
Now that you have refreshed your understanding of boolean expressions turn over and attempt the **code correction** tasks with a partner.

###Task 1
Look at each of the following expressions, without using a computer what would they evaluate to?

|Expression|Result|
|:--------:|------|
|````5 + 3 * 2````| |
|````3 / 2 * 3````| |
|````2 ** 2 + 3````| |
|````3 // 2````| |
|````3 % 2````| |
|````3 / 2````| |

###Task 2
Describe what is meant by the term variable.

|Term|Defintion|
|----|---------|
|Variable| |

###Task 3
Look at each of the following expressions that include variables, without using a computer what would they evaluate to?

````python
num1 = 54
num2 = 32
````

|Expression|Result|
|:--------:|------|
|````5 + num1````| |
|````num2 * 4````| |
|````num1 / num2````| |
|````num1 // 4````| |
|````num2 % 5````| |
|````num1 - num2````| |

##Variable Identifiers
Each variable must have an identifier (a name) which clear distinguishes it from another variable. Each programming language has its own conventions that should be followed.

###Task 4
Look at each of the following variable identifiers, determine whether the identifier is appropriate or not and explain why this is the case.

|Variable Identifier|Appropriate (Yes or No)|Explanation|
|:-----------------:|:------------------:|-----------|
|````total````| | |
|````a````| | |
|````total_score````| | |
|````print````| | |
|````player_one_score_for_hockey_on_saturday````| | |

##Dealing With Simple Errors
All programmers (even experienced ones) make mistakes in their code. This results in error messages being generated by the Python interpreter. You need to be able to understand these error messages and fix any mistakes you encounter.

###Task 5
Look at each screenshot and try to explain why an error message is being generated.

|Screenshot|Explanation|
|----------|-----------|

|![](images/type_error.jpg)| |
